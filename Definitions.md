SHP file  :   

A shapefile is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of 
geographic features. 
Geographic features in a shapefile can be represented by points, 
lines, or polygons (areas). The workspace containing shapefiles may also contain dBASE tables, 
which can store additional attributes that can be joined to a shapefile's features.


OSM File   : 

The OpenStreetMap data model is a powerful yet simple way to represent geographic information.
 Understanding the data model enables you to interact with OpenStreetMap data in its raw form so that you can manipulate
 it into formats that are more useful for what you're trying to do. You'll want to understand the data model if you are 
 interested in writing a map editor, converting the raw OpenStreetMap data into a format for use in an application, 
 or if any of the existing software tools don't provide functionality that you want.

GeoJSON FIle : 


GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. 
A GeoJSON object may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features. 
GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon,
 and GeometryCollection. Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and a feature collection
 represents a list of features.


GPX       : 

GPX (the GPS eXchange Format) is a data format for exchanging GPS data between programs,
 and for sharing GPS data with other users. Unlike other data files, which can only be understood by the programs
 that created them, GPX files actually contain a description of what's inside them, allowing anyone to create a program
 that can read the data within.


KML      : 


Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML-based markup language designed to annotate and overlay visualizations 
on various two-dimensional, Web-based online maps or three-dimensional Earth browsers (such as Google Earth).
 In fact, KML was initially developed for use with Google Earth; because that project was originally named Keyhole, 
 as was the company that undertook this work, the related markup language followed suit. When Google acquired Keyhole in 2004, 
 that project came with it and eventually became Google Earth. The "keyhole" moniker is a reference to the original KH military
 reconnaissance satellites first launched in the mid-1970s that took the very first "eye-in-the-sky" photographs so commonly viewed
 within Google Earth and other geobrowsers. 


 NMEA    : 
 
 Your GPS receiver might output or record your tracks in NMEA format, this is a format that can easily be converted to GPX
 so you can upload it to our website. Even though GPX is preferred there are still several OpenStreetMap tools that support NMEA including new versions of JOSM.
 
 
 CSV      :  
  
 A CSV file is commonly described as a ‘Comma Delimited File’ or a ‘Character Separated File’.
 The second description is more accurate since any character including the comma, can be used to delineate each piece of data. 
 For example, a TSV file, ‘commonly known as a ‘Tab Delimited File’, is really just a special case of a CSV file.
 Since a CSV file is a simple text file (ASCII or Unicode) it can be easily opened by Notepad.exe which is included in all
 versions of MS Windows.
 
 
QGIS      :   


QGIS understands three major forms of data. Two of these are spatial (ie, they contain information allows it to be shown in space) and the third contains no spatial data (" aspatial data")

The two spatial data types are:
Vector data. Vector data can be drawn by lines of varying lengths; that is points, lines or polygons. 
In QGIS vector files can only contain one of these three types in a file.
Raster data. These are images, jpg, tif, etc. These files are accompanied by or contain information that allows
them to be shown in space. 


GPS BAREL  : 

GPSBabel is an easy-to-use program that haa two main uses:
1. Delorme users can use it to collapse POI's to a small red dot above a user-specified Draw Level.
2. For all users, GPSBabel will let you convert almost any map format file to almost any other map format file.
 Owners of stand-alone GPS devices (or other map software programs) that have the ability to import map files can easily
 convert a map file to the format required for their device.
